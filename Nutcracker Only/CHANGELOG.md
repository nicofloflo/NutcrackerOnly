###### v1.0.5

###### 1.0.6

- Moved Spawn Curves forward for faster gaming and nutcracker shooting 
  - Experimentation/Assurance/Vow push spawn curve four hours into the future with the idea of these are the moons to get an early shotgun
  - Offense/Adamance due to the increased power levels of these moons I have only moved one point of the curve closer meaning that if you stay long on these moons you will gain more value from them
  - March has the same principle as the moons above HOWEVER on this moon outside nutcrackers spawn throughout the day making the march forests into a WW1 battleground
  - Rend now has an immediate spawning nutcrackers that make it fierce it could be a play as the first mansion map
  - Dine now has immediate spawning nutcrackers but with the spawn rate even higher that Rend the mineshaft tunnels of Dine could actually be a savior if you are out a few bucks
  - TITAN - Titan is a moon that could possibly take on Artifice with this pack when it comes to speed and dropping it is the second-fastest moon when it comes to spawning.
  - Artifice - Artifice has been made into the most insane moon due to the fact it's supposed to be the maximum amount of scrap you can get
    - Artifice's first change is a now max power level of 24 meaning a lot of nuts considering how nuts the next change is.
    - Artifice now has the highest spawning level compared to how quiet it usually is.
    - Artifice's dungeon layouts are now = to Rends dungeon layouts
- Due to all these insane changes, the price of shotguns had to be dropped to its base level of 60 requiring 6.23 shotguns on average a day to complete all ten quotas.
