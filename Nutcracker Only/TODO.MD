### TODO

### BUGS

- after eclipsed day, day after works fine however day after that no outside enemies ✅
- Ammo if reloaded both shells gives you 1000 pounds ✅ (changes to easter eggs)
- Accidentally put Assurance instead of Experimentation for only Nut spawns (found that out the hard way) ✅
- Outdoor Nutcrackers are considered to by inside enemies which makes them go to a specific node want to separate entities from outside to inside ✅
